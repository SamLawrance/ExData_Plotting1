## Introduction

For marker: all 4 R scripts are self contained.  They will look for the data file household_power_consumption.txt under "data/" in the current working directory.  The scripts will download and uncompress the data file if it does not already exist there.

The output PNG files are written to the current working directory as well - typically either your home directory on OSX/Linux or (I guess) your user directory under windows, unless you set it otherwise beforehand.
